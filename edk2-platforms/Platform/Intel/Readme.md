# **EDK II Minimum Platform Firmware for Intel&reg; Platforms**

The Minimum Platform is a software architecture that guides uniform delivery of Intel platforms enabling firmware
solutions for basic boot functionality with extensibility built-in. Please see the
[EDK II Minimum Platform Draft Specification](https://edk2-docs.gitbooks.io/edk-ii-minimum-platform-specification/)
for more details.

Package maintainers for the Minimum Platform projects are listed in Maintainers.txt.

## Overview
The key elements of the architecture are organized into a staged boot approach where each stage has requirements and
functionality for specific use cases. The generic control flow through the boot process is implemented in the
[`MinPlatformPkg`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/MinPlatformPkg).
The generic nature of the tasks performed in MinPlatformPkg lends to reuse across all Intel platforms with no
source modification. Details for any particular board are made accessible to the MinPlatformPkg through a well-defined
statically linked board API. A complete platform solution then consists of the MinPlatformPkg and a compatible board
package.

## Board Naming Convention
The board packages supported by Intel follow the naming convention \<xxx\>OpenBoardPkg where xxx refers to the
encompassing platform name for a particular platform generation. For example, the [`KabylakeOpenBoardPkg`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/KabylakeOpenBoardPkg) contains the
board code for Intel KabyLake reference systems. Intel uses the moniker "OpenBoardPkg" to indicate that this package
is the open source board code. A closed source counterpart may exist which simply uses "BoardPkg". Both directly use
the MinPlatformPkg from edk2-platforms.

## Stage Selection
Stage selection is controlled via the PCD `gMinPlatformPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdBootStage` in [`MinPlatformPkg.dec`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/MinPlatformPkg/MinPlatformPkg.dec).
The stage should be configured in the board package DSC file to the appropriate value. For example, a board may disable
all advanced features by setting this value to 4 instead of 6. This may be used to improve boot time for a particular
use case. Decrementing the stage can also be used for debug since only the actions required for that stage objective
should be executed. As an example, ACPI initialization is not required for a Stage 3 boot.

The stages are defined as follows:

| Stage  | Functional Objective         | Example Capabilities                                                                               |
| -------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I      | Minimal Debug                | Serial port output, source debug enabled, hardware debugger enabled                                |
| II     | Memory Functional            | Basic hardware initialization necessary to reach memory initialization, permanent memory available |
| III    | Boot to UI                   | Simple console input and output to a UI, UEFI shell                                                |
| IV     | Boot to OS                   | Boot an operating system with the minimally required features                                      |
| V      | Security Enable              | UEFI Secure Boot, TCG measured boot, DMA protections                                               |
| VI     | Advanced Feature Enable      | Firmware update, power management, non-essential I/O                                               |

## Board Package Organization
The board package follows the standard EDK II package structure with the following additional elements and guidelines:
* Only code usable across more than one board at the root level.
* Board-specific code in a directory. The directory name should match that of the board supported.
* Features not essential to achieve stage 5 or earlier boots are maintained in edk2-platforms/Features/Intel.

Shared resources in the package root directory can include interfaces described in header files, library instances,
firmware modules, binaries, etc. The UEFI firmware implementation is built using the process described below from the
board-specific directory.

A board package must implement the board APIs defined in the MinPlatformPkg even if a "NULL" implementation is used to
return back to the minimum platform caller.

### **Known limitations**

**KabylakeOpenBoardPkg**
*GalagoPro3*
1. The firmware project has not been tested on the Galago Pro 3B.

*KabylakeRvp3*
1. This firmware project has only been tested for Microsoft Windows 10 x64 boot with AHCI mode and Integrated Graphic
   Device.

**SimicsOpenBoardPkg**
1. This firmware project has only been tested booting to Microsoft Windows 10 x64 and Ubuntu 17.10 with AHCI mode.

**WhiskeylakeOpenBoardPkg**
1. This firmware project has only been tested booting to Microsoft Windows 10 x64 with AHCI mode and Integrated Graphic
   Device.

**CometlakeOpenBoardPkg**
1. This firmware project has been tested booting to Microsoft Windows 10 x64 with AHCI mode and External Graphic Device.
2. This firmware project has been also tested booting to Ubuntu 17.10 with AHCI mode and Integrated Graphic Device.

### **Package Builds**

In some cases, such as BoardModulePkg, a package may provide a set of functionality that is included in other
packages. To test the build of the whole package, the "build" command should be used following the instructions below.

1. Execute edksetup.bat (Windows) or edksetup.sh (Linux).
2. Verify the "WORKSPACE" environment variable is set to the edk2 directory in your workspace.
3. Set the "PACKAGES_PATH" environment variable to include the edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel, edk2-platforms/Silicon/Intel,
   and edk2-platforms/Features/Intel directories.
   * Windows example: set PACKAGES_PATH=c:\Edk2Workspace\edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel;
     c:\Edk2Workspace\edk2-platforms\Silicon\Intel;c:\Edk2Workspace\edk2-platforms\Features\Intel
4. Build the package by specifying the package DSC as the platform build target from the Platform/Intel or Silicon/Intel directory:
   "build -p BoardModulePkg/BoardModulePkg.dsc -a IA32 -a X64"


### **Firmware Image Flashing**

The full Intel firmware image on a flash device is called the Integrated Firmware Image (IFWI). Users with access to the Intel
proprietary FITC tool and ME ingredients can build full IFWI images that may be flashed (Descriptor, UEFI FW, ME FW, etc.).

Users without such access can directly flash a custom built UEFI FW image over the highest area of the flash region directly.
It is always recommended to have a hardware flash programmer accessible to recover the firmware image. The original full flash
image should always be backed up so it may be flashed again for recovery. Please be aware that if a system supports a technology
that authenticates the initial firmware boot image such as Boot Guard, it will fail to boot with a custom firmware image
that is not signed properly.

### **Planned Activities**
* Expand Intel's open source platform code presence through new platform and board support.
* Expand advanced feature code and quality.
* Support open source community continuous integration for Minimum Platform compliant boards.

### **Ideas**
If you would like to help but are not sure where to start some areas currently identified for improvement include:
 * Adding board ports for more motherboards and systems
 * Adding Clang support

Please feel free to contact Michael Kubacki (michael.a.kubacki at intel.com) and Isaac Oram (isaac.w.oram at intel.com)
if you would like to discuss contribution ideas.
